tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.

tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached. This is especially useful for maintaining persistent SSH sessions on remote servers.

Key Features:
- Session management: Create, detach, and reattach terminal sessions
- Window management: Multiple windows within a single session
- Pane splitting: Split windows horizontally or vertically
- Session sharing: Multiple users can attach to the same session
- Scriptable: Automate complex terminal layouts
- Persistent sessions: Sessions survive network disconnections

This package provides tmux binaries compiled from source for ASUSTOR NAS devices, enabling powerful terminal multiplexing directly on your NAS.
